2019 Spring Summit
******************

These are my notes from the 2019 Spring Summit in Beijing.

Opening remarks
================

The primary message was we as a community need to do better about testing at production levels.
Bringing ATS 8.0.x to production quality has been a long struggle and 8.1.x is not going well either.
A problem I see is that as the production testing takes longer, the difference between the LTS release
and the next release gets larger, which makes the whole process take longer. This is a degenerative
spiral that will end badly.

We need to do better about reviewing pull requests, in particular to get reviews across company
silos. I think people should do this also because it's good for the reviewer.

Plugin API and WebAssembly
==========================

Web assembly is the new fad of a byte code executor which can be run in a web browser. The
ostensible point is to subsume the variety of languages currently used in active web pages to a
single basic feature [#zend]_. Developers would be able to write code in a variety of lanagues, which is
condensed to byte code and then executed in a engine based run time environment.

Kit is concerned about the long term viability of the Lua community, given that luajit and other
libraries have been abandoned. If ATS has a WebAssembly engine, then plugins could be done the
same way.

All of this is still very wide open - many different incompatible tool chains floating around.

.. topic:: Commentary

    It occurs to me as I write this that there may be some performance implications. It's hard to
    believe the byte code machine can be as fast as native C code. We have some plugins where plugin
    performance is a significant issue.

QUIC Updates
============

*  HTTP over QUIC is now 'HTTP/3".

    *  Multipath is coming, but final docuemnt not due until May 2020.

*  Still targeting ATS 9.0.

   *  OpenSSL doesn't support API required for QUIC (any supported release at this time). Masaori
      said there are not current plans to ever support this API. This would require a custome openSSL
      build for ATS to use openSSL and QUIC.

   *  BoringSSL has QUIC API.

   *  Results from IETF 103, 104 QUIC WG tested against 16 other versions.

      * Depending HTTP/2 outbound for certain client side features.

*  Working on performance improvements, implementation was very slow.

*  Cleanup of loading certificates from "ssl_multicert.config".

*  Review is going to be hard - already 43K lines changed.

There was a long discussion on how and when to bring this in to master.

*  A key issue is how many changes are expected in the future. Moving to master will mean a large
   slow down in commit speed, because reviews will be required for each PR. Currently the QUIC branch
   has 1300 commits over two years, which is a very high velocity for this project.

One problem is that if QUIC doesn't go in to ATS 9, it will be another 12-18 months before it is
released in a supported version.

QUIC Deployment
===============

This was about actually deploying a variant of the ATS QUIC implementation (draft 12) in production.

Reasons for QUIC

*  RTT costs.

*  Head of Line blocking

*  Mobile connection switching vs. QUIC routing. Possibly load balancers can route by DCID embedded
   in QUIC packets. Unclear this is commerciall available without local changes. DCID contents
   encode the ``ET_NET`` thread in this deployment. ``UDP_NET`` threads get packets at random
   and reschedule to the appropriate ``ET_NET`` thread.

.. topic:: Commentary

   I'm not sure how of much of a QUIC advantage these things are any more. Most (all?) of them have
   been migrated back into TCP stacks. E.g. `MPTCP <http://multipath-tcp.org>`__.

Using "BRR" congestion control vs. "New Reno" which is the IETF QUIC recommendation. Claims 10x
speed improvement for transfering 1MB in 5% packet loss environment. This approximates some third
world networks.

Using `SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY
<https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/gDzOxgKQADVfItfC4NyW3ylr7yc>`__. Getting 79%
~ 98% sessions reuse for 0-RTT.

ATS Internals
=============

A discussion of ATS internal architecture (based on 6.0.x).

AOI
---

Asynchronous I/O. This is a thread based module that does blocking I/O internally and provides
an asynchronous interface using mutex locking and lockless queues.

.. topic:: Commentary

    Should look at using atomics instead of an insert mutex for the AIO queue. That might be
    problematic for removes.

.. topic:: Commentary

    As far as oknet can tell, the AIO priority isn't used. This implies we may want to look at
    removing the internal sorted priority queue, since it's not doing anything useful.

There is also the native `Linux AIO <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html>`__ system.
Structured similarly to `epoll <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html>`__.

DNS
---

Table of in flight DNS queries, with de-dupping. Each entry can have a list of continuations waiting
on the results for that query. Can have dedicated DNS thread or share with an ``ET_NET`` thread.

Transform Connections
---------------------

This is a chain of continuations that process data serially. There is a special :code:`TransformTerminus`
created by the core which anchor the chain.

.. topic:: Commentary

   I need to get back to providing some more control in this chain. The idea at one point was to
   be able to pass hints along about how the transform was modifying the content, particularly
   with regard to length. There would be potential performance improvements if a transform could
   mark itself as read only or length preserving.

The diagrams were done in `OmniGraffle <https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle>`__.

Thread Scheduling
=================

The real point of all of this is to support thread affinity. The API is designed to make this
behave in an orderly and expected way. Conceptually each thread can have an affine thread which
belongs to a specific thread pool. This makes it possible to easily schedule a continuation on
the same thread every time, particularly when switching threads. E.g. something does a DNS request
and needs to be scheduled back to ``ET_NET`` from ``ET_DNS``.

Talk about clean shutdown, primarily to avoid crashes from out of order clean up of static data.

JEMalloc differences are small - order of 1-2% more for JEMalloc. However, having some locking
issues under stress, still investigating.

CWiki Changes
=============

Generally agreed. The concensus was

*  If it's about the software, it goes in Sphinx in the code base.
*  If it's about the community, it goes in the Wiki.
*  Projects go to github projects.

Plugin Reload
=============

Goal is to change plugin code by loading new versions of dynamic libraries, cleaning up the old
ones. Old code needs to be removed to do cleanup and to release resources.

One issue is the internal dynamic library loader tracks the loaded library files, not reloading if
already loaded. This isn't affected by replacing the dynmaic library file.

This change does Continuation context tracking, using the mechanism from the Plugin Coordination
project. That is, each Continuation has a member that is a pointer to a context. When a Continuation
is created the context is passed from the executing Continuation to the Continuation being created.

This is only for remap plugins and remap configuration reload.

The context objects are reference counted so that the context is preserved as long as a Continuation
is using it. This leads to the problem with plugins that schedules events after a transaction or
does a persistent periodic task. In this case it would be possible to accumulate a large number of
old plugin context objects. There is also the problem that the plugin could have multiple instances
running concurrently. To me this seems to overlap with Fei's work on clean shutdown. This is
fundamentally the same, where a version of a plugin needs to shut down in a clean manner. Because
this particular case it's less of an issue because there is already a hook for shutting down remap
plugin instances.

Leif went on at great length about optimizing the reloading of the dynamic libraries. It would be
worthwhile to keep a modified time stamp for each dynamic library and only actually reload if that
time has changed. This is because it's quite unusual for the dynamic library to change, it's a rare
but critical case.

In the long run we want to unify global and remap plugins, so there are only plugins. This means
being able to reload any plugin, and having hooks for global plugins to indicate load, reload, and
shutdown. The plugin context structures would also be unified. In the not so long term, we can look
at providing hooks for global plugins to be informed of dynamic library reloads.

Discussion on :code:`TSRemapOSResponse` - what is the use of this? Kit said it was because it is
always called, in contrast to :code:`ReadResponseHdrHook` which is only called after a successful
connection to the upstream. Using both enables detecting upstream connection failures.

Discussion on whether this should be optional - is that useful? One argument is that it would ease
transition. Is it sufficient to just make the "only reload if the timestamp changed" update?

Parent Selection and traffic_manager
====================================

Project goal is to be able to have more complex selection criteria for upstream selection.

Added ability mark upstream status, via :program:`traffic_ctl` or plugin API. This includes
reasons for the status.

A major problem has been the only data that flows *from* :program:`traffic_server` *to*
:program:`traffic_manager` is statistics, and so that has been used. However this approach
does not scale well. This is another aspect of how the internal RPC is messed up.

Working on

*  updating to YAML for "parent.config" and better integration with "remap.config".

*  API support for tweaking selection strategies.

The only thing that :program:`traffic_manager` provides that is not easily put into
:program:`traffic_server` is the external process RPC. To me, this is once again wrapped up with
the overall brokenness of the RPC.

`Long discussion about RPC <rpc>`_.

TLS State of the Onion
======================

Susan's slides, I couldn't take notes.

Masaori talked about refactoring "ssl_multicert.config" based on work with QUIC.

Require openSSL 1.0.2+ for ATS 9
   This means droppping support for CentOS 6 and Ubuntu 14.04. Currently ATS 8 only requires
   openSSL 0.9.4+ which is far too old.

Common Mistakes for Configuration
   Frequent use of `#ifdef` instead of `#if`.

   Use of :code:`AC_CHECK_HEADER` definitions without actually calling ;code:`AC_CHECK_HEADER`.

Cleanup
   *  Replace tokenizer with :code:`TextView`.
   *  Drop NPN support for ATS 9?
   *  Agreed that "I\_" and "P\_" prefixes are obsolete and should be removed.

Need to talk about how to organize include files in order to deprecate the "I\_" and "P\_" prefixes.

We want to move the "ssl\_" prefixed functions from globals to a namespace.


Plugin Review
=============

Concern about the process of promoting plugins from experiment to stable. Therefore this is a
walk through of current plugins and what should be done with them.

access_control
   Remain experimental.

acme
   Unclear about what this does and what support it has. This supports "Let's Encrypt" use. "Acme"
   is a protocol of which "Let's Encrypt" is an implementation. Remain experimental.

balancer
   Deprecate? This is being moved in to the core.

buffer_upload
   Ancient and unchanging. Should be deprecated or promoted.

cache_key_genid
   What does this do? Look at deprecating, move functionality into another plugin.

cache_promote
   Promote to stable.

cache_range_requests
   Used by :program:`traffic_ctl`. Promote when documented.

cachekey
   Already promoted.

certifier
   Promote to stable or move to examples. Much of this is being moved in to the core.

collapsed_forwarding
   Check with Comcast. Used by Kit.

cookie_remap
   Keep in experimental.

custom_redirect
   Investigate - does any one use this?

fastcgi
   Remain experimental.

fq_pacing
   Remain experimental.

geoip_acl
   Remain experimental.

header_freq
   Remain experimental.

header_normalize
   Deprecate. Obsolete functionality.

hipes
   Deprecate. Obsolete functionality.

hook-trace
   Experimental

inliner
   Consider deprecating? Functionality covered by :code:`pagespeed`?

ja3_fingerprint
   Experimental.

magick
   Experimental.

memcache
   Deprecate. Move to example as a prorotocol plugin example?

memcached_remap
   Deprecate.

metalink
   Remain experimental.

money_trace
   JvD will ask if this is still viable.

mp4
   Remain experimental.

multiplexer
   Promote to stable.

mysql_remap
   Deprecate.

prefetch
   Promote to stable.

remap_purge
   Promote to stable.

remap_stats
   Promote when documented.

server_push_preload
   Remain experimental.

slicer
   Remain experimental.

webp_transform
   Functionality replaced by :code:`magick`. Deprecate when the latter is promoted.

ssl_session_reuse
   Remain experimental.

sslheaders
   Remain experimental. Try to move functionality to :code:`header_rewrite`.

stale_while_revalidate
   Deprecated already. Should remove code.

stream_editor
   Remain experimental.

system_stats
   Remain experimental.

tls_bridge
   Remain experimental.

traffic_dump
   Remain experimental.

uri_signing
   Remain experimental.

url_sig
   Remain experimental.

Kubernetes
==========

Project goal is to support Kubernetes as a general corporate infrastructure. ATS would be used as
a routing engine.

Using :program:`tmgr_plugin` because the frequency of updates is on the same scale as the time
delay for :program:`traffic_ctl` making the latter unusable in production.

ATS is put in a docker container image, using an image built from a local build along with plugins
and configuration. This is then deployed as part of a Kubernetes pod.

There is a caching ATS in the Kubernetes infrastructure, then the "parent.config" is updated
automatically to forward requests to the caching  instance(s). This means that updating the
"parent.config" means doing a full configuration reload. It would be nice to be able to do more
incremental updates to the upstream selection.

To integrate ATS in to Kubernetes we would need something to process from Kubernetes YAML to
ATS configurations. This may already exist, done by unixwitch, but it hasn't been updated since
July 2017.

Remap
=====

A descent in to madness. Leif pushed for doing a complete redesign of url rewriting and other
configurations. The idea is that remap is restructured along different lines in order to support
more complex configurations. We would also incorporate other configurations that are URL dependent,
such as "hosting.config", in to the URL rewrite. In essence URL rewrite becomes something like what
was envisioned for Layer 7 Routing, where a request is passed in to a feature extractor and then
a decision tree, which yields a data record. That record determines behavior for the request for
various modules (e.g. upstream selection, cache properties, etc.).

There was no real resolution, execpt Miles seems to have gotten stuck with leading a working group
to do the design. I managed to limit myself to just doing the coding and YAML support.

Although the current project for YAML for "remap.config" is not going to fly, some general comments
were

*  Get rid of named filters entirely. All filters must be defined in line per rule. To save typing,
   if that's desired, YAML anchors and references could be used.

*  Rule 3 [#rule3]_ for filters was grudgingly accepted. It wasn't liked, but it was agreed it
   matched the "intuitive" behavior.

*  Filters should not affect matching.

*  It's fine to unify all the rules and use extra tags / options to map to existing types of rules.

General Notes
=============

Leif wants it to be noted the rule about string manipulation should be

.. centered:: Use :code:`std::string_view` unless methods from :code:`ts::TextView` are explicitly needed.

.. _rpc:

There's general agreement the current internal RPC is messed up and/or broken. It's also the
concensus that a `JSON-RPC <http://jsonrpc.org>`__ compatible protocol should be used.

Discussion on how the external connectivity for the RPC - should it be done via the normal proxy
ports or keep it as a specialized communication channel (e.g. via UNIX domain sockets). Long
discussion about this. I think there is more concern about the complexity of the transport than is
warrented. I also think even if the overall implementations are different between a custom channel
and an HTTP based channel are different, the core implementation is identical. That part is the
request parsing, dispatch, and response generation.

.. topic:: Commentary

    I have no doubt a proxy port based approach would be quite nice in many ways. My concern is
    primarily that the additional complexity due to security concerns will be more than the effort
    to make it work on a custom channel. I understand what is needed for the latter case but we
    don't seem to have any designs for how to deal with the security issues for the former.

Kit brought up the issue of :program:`traffic_manager` keeping the proxy ports open means the listen
queue for the proxy ports is also maintained across :program:`traffic_server` restarts. It would be
possible to write a custom wrapper that does this in very little code. Miles pointed out this can
also be handled by fronting load balancers, even though they are on different hardware. From the
point of view of the inbound client this is irrelevant.

.. topic:: Commentary

    I think I should make an attempt at doing this quickly, to try to get the scope better in mind
    and determine who is correct about the level of effort. At a minimum I can get the parse,
    dispatch, response logic working which will be required for any eventuality. Also there have
    been numerous instances where the poor RPC implementation has been a blocker.

Footnotes
=========

.. [#zend] This reminds me very much of `Zend Project <https://www.php.net/manual/en/internals2.ze1.php>`__.
   I'm not sure why this wasn't used, but maybe it was.
